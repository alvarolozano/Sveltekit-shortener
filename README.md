# Sveltekit-shortener (powered by PocketBase)

I have been using Next.js for almost 1 year. It is my favourite framework, but SvelteKit seems to be a great alternative (also has unique functionalities). This is a personal project with this goals:
- [ ] Go deeper with Svelte/SvelteKit
- [ ] Build an useful tool for my personal use
- [ ] Develop my first PocketBase backend (I normally build from scratch or use other CMS such as Strapi)

## Test it now
https://router.alvarolozano.dev

## Local development
1. Clone the repo
2. Make an npm/pnpm/yarn install
3. Get the latest PocketBase binary release
4. Follow the instructions and import the database structure from the `db.json` file
5. Create a .env file and set the `PB_URL` variable to PocketBase's root url
